Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; whose misadventured piteous overthrows do with their death bury their parents' strife.
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
What's in a name? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet; so Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Thus with a kiss I die.
